# GaiaDex
This is an Android app I created to help keep track of some of the patches I create on my Roland Gaia synth.  
It's a great instrument, but it can be a nightmare to keep track of the patches you create.

The Gaia has 64 empty patches that can be overwritten by the user.  When overwriting a patch, the settings of the custom patche are 
saved to a letter (A-H) and a number (1-8).  

Let's say I write a patch to location 'G4' on one day...  Next week, I go back to the synthsizer and I want to find that same patch.  
Without the app, I had to either write down where the patch was located or I would have to click 
between letters and numbers in the hopes that I would find it eventually.

And that's why I decided to create this app for my Android.  It's been pretty cool so far!

Thanks for watching.
